## 1. Types of Analysis Performed

### Univariate Analysis
- **What was done:** Explored the distribution of individual features (e.g., age, cholesterol, BMI).
- **Why:** To understand the basic characteristics and detect any skewness or anomalies in single variables.
- **Findings:** Age and cholesterol distributions are right-skewed, indicating most values are clustered at lower ranges with a tail to the right.

### Bivariate Analysis
- **What was done:** Analyzed relationships between two variables, especially between features and the target (cardio).
- **Why:** To identify correlations, class imbalances, and how features relate to the outcome.
- **Findings:** Found class imbalance (more cardio=1 than cardio=0), and correlations between blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular outcome.

### Multivariate Analysis
- **What was done:** Assessed interactions among multiple variables simultaneously.
- **Why:** To uncover complex patterns, clusters, and high-risk groups that may not be visible in simpler analyses.
- **Findings:** Identified patterns and clusters of high-risk individuals, such as those with high BP, cholesterol, and BMI.

## 2. Key Visualizations & Their Logic

### Histograms
- **What:** Show the distribution of numerical features (e.g., age, weight, BMI).
- **Why chosen:** To quickly visualize the spread, central tendency, and skewness of data.
- **How it supports findings:** Helped detect right-skewness in age and cholesterol, and spot outliers.

### Boxplots
- **What:** Visualize the spread and outliers in features like height, weight, and BMI.
- **Why chosen:** Boxplots are ideal for identifying outliers and comparing distributions across groups.
- **How it supports findings:** Confirmed the presence of outliers in height and weight, supporting data cleaning and feature engineering decisions.

### Heatmaps
- **What:** Show correlation between features (e.g., BP, cholesterol, cardio outcome).
- **Why chosen:** Heatmaps provide a clear overview of how variables are related.
- **How it supports findings:** Revealed moderate correlations between some features and cardiovascular disease, guiding feature selection.

### Bar Plots (Categorical Analysis)
- **What:** Display the distribution of categorical features (e.g., smoking status, hypertension stage).
- **Why chosen:** Bar plots make it easy to compare category frequencies.
- **How it supports findings:** Showed, for example, that 91% are non-smokers and 60% have Hypertension Stage 1.

### Pie Charts
- **What:** Show the proportion of categories within a feature (e.g., BMI categories).
- **Why chosen:** Pie charts are effective for visualizing proportions at a glance.
- **How it supports findings:** Illustrated the prevalence of obesity (25%) and other BMI categories.

### Line Plots (Bivariate Analysis)
- **What:** Show relationships between two numerical features (e.g., weight vs. BMI).
- **Why chosen:** Line plots reveal trends and linear relationships.
- **How it supports findings:** Demonstrated a strong, nearly linear relationship between BMI and weight.

### Scatter Plots (Multivariate Analysis)
- **What:** Visualize interactions among multiple features (e.g., weight, height, BP, cholesterol).
- **Why chosen:** Scatter plots are powerful for spotting clusters, trends, and outliers in multidimensional data.
- **How it supports findings:** Helped identify clusters of obese individuals and links between high BP, cholesterol, and heart disease.

## 3. Key Insights from Analysis
- Age and cholesterol are right-skewed.
- The dataset is imbalanced (more positive cases of cardiovascular disease).
- Outliers exist in height and weight.
- Some features (BP, cholesterol) show moderate correlation with cardiovascular disease.
- 91% are non-smokers; 95% avoid alcohol; 25% are obese; 60% have Hypertension Stage 1.
- Higher cholesterol and weight increase heart disease risk; obesity pushes risk to 62%.
- Hypertension Stage 2 increases risk to 80%.
- BMI and weight have a strong linear relationship.
- Higher weights with average heights are mostly obese.
- Higher BP is strongly associated with heart disease.
- Average age increases with cholesterol, linking aging and cholesterol.

## 4. Logic Behind Analysis & Visuals (For Q&A)
- **Univariate analysis** is the foundation: it helps you understand each variable before looking at relationships. Skewness and outliers can affect modeling, so detecting them early is crucial.
- **Bivariate analysis** uncovers how features relate to the target and to each other. This is key for feature selection and understanding what drives the outcome.
- **Multivariate analysis** is necessary for real-world data, where risk factors interact. It helps identify high-risk groups and complex patterns.
- **Visualizations** are chosen for clarity and interpretability. Each plot type is matched to the data type and analysis goal (e.g., histograms for distributions, scatter plots for interactions).
- **Class imbalance** is important because it affects model performance and evaluation. Recognizing it early allows for better handling during modeling.
- **Correlations** guide which features are most relevant for prediction and help avoid multicollinearity.
- **Outliers** can distort models and need to be addressed or understood.

## 5. Brief Summary of Other Work
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (removing outliers, handling missing values).
- Feature engineering (creating new features, encoding categorical variables).
- Model development and optimization (not detailed here, but supported by the analysis above).
- Reporting and documentation (all steps and findings are well-documented for transparency).
